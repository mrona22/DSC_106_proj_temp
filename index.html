        <h3>Write Up</h3>
        <p>
          During our initial exploration of the data, Matti created multiple exploratory plots to understand the data. Many of these graphs focused on comparing female and male mice
          over time. A clear trend of activity and temperature between genders was noticed, so we decided to focus on documenting this comparison. Some of the first graphs also compared
          individual mice, rather than the grouped averages. We found the results of this to also be telling, so we decided to implement the ability for the user to select a mouse
          to be plotted. Additionally, since the initial graph had a random mouse selected, the option to randomize the mouse chosen was added.
        </p>
        <p>
          For our first interactive graph, we plotted the mean body temperatures of male and female mice over the entire two-week period. However, we quickly realized that the graph
          became difficult to read with the constant rises and dips of the data. Milan then created a second plot that averaged the temperatures of the mice according to the hour.
          This lead to a cleaner and effective plot that we began to incorporate more interactive elements to. A tooltip that visualizes the change in activity and a normal distribution
          of the temperature makes the data even easier to read. Trends of the mice's activity and temperature are clearer to differentiate by the minute and we highlighted a portion
          that we found the difference to be the clearest. As the user scrolls through the highlighted section, the changes in the male activity arrow and temperature distribution
          fluctuate wildly, and we hoped to showcase this by emphasizing the region.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matti then incorporated features from the old graph into the new one, such as the ability for the user to select a male and female mouse if so desired. Jas built upon this feature,
          including buttons that randomize the selected mouse for males and females. A reset button was also included for when the user wishes to return to the initial plot.
          Connie worked through the stylization of the webpage, formatting the text and colors to make the visualization more appealing and palatable. She established a theme on the
          webpage that the group used throughout the visualization, such as the mouse selection dropdown and buttons. Options to toggle between light and dark mode are available for
          the user as well. Along with the ability to play the Ratatouille theme.
